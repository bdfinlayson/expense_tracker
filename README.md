# To-Do
* For recurring expenses, a 'trigger' button that will send the expense to the pending table for clearing (to help with the use case for manually paying a recurring expense before the due date)
* Cards for Overview page (pending and transactions, total spent for month, budget info, etc) (see Barclays app for examples)
* Category Stats modal that shows expenses for a category over time (user can select time range)
* Vendor Stats modal that shows expenses for a vendor over time (user can select time range)
* Additional columns on Vendor for phone, email, account #, address, website, etc
* improved searching / filtering / sorting via date created, date range, category, vendor, price, recurring
* email alerts for recurring expense / income events
* email alerts for budget approaching limit and budget exceeded events
* set cutoff date for recurring expense / income
* for expenses, if loan or financing expense, add column for date when 0% financing period ends and interest starts
* list categories that are not yet budgeted for
* improved category and vendor selection using selectize
* user profile page (name, email, etc) (See Barclays app for examples)
* total net worth (including cash on hand, bank account totals) after accounting for expenses and revenue
